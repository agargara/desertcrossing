## Controls

Tap/mobile friendly controls?

## Upgrades

After crossing desert, gain resources
Establish new camps

## Ending

Width	1,800 km 
Area	9,200,000 kmÂ²

## Rejected ideas
Raiders: Random raids of fuel deposits, random encounters, battle system?
^ Rejected because battle systems are overdone...instead focus on pure math, numbers, interesting systems, gradually adding complexity
